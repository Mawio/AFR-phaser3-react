Suggestions

- Use full driver names and both team colors in timing column for easier identification
- Speed controls
- Pause/play/rewind/etc.
- Live standings?
- Display lapped drivers as "+x Laps" rather than thair time to leader
- More starting grid information in the prelude
- Podium after the race
